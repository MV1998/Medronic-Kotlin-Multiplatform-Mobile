Medronic – Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile Playground
📱 Overview

Medronic is a Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) learning project focused on building shared business logic with native UIs using:

Jetpack Compose for Android

SwiftUI for iOS

Instead of creating multiple separate KMM repositories, this project acts as a single, structured KMM workspace where multiple mini-projects live together.

Each feature or experiment is organized section-wise at the package/module level, making it easier to learn, iterate, and compare implementations without managing many repositories.

🎯 Primary Goal

The primary goal of this project is to learn and master Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile by:

Sharing common business logic across Android and iOS

Building fully native UIs on each platform

Exploring real-world use cases inside a single KMM project

This repository is designed as a learning lab, not a production app.

🧩 Project Structure Philosophy

Instead of creating a new KMM project for every idea:

✅ One main KMM project

✅ Multiple package-level / feature-level mini projects

✅ Each section focuses on a specific concept, use case, or experiment

Example ideas for sections:

Authentication

Networking

State management

Database & caching

UI + ViewModel integration

Platform-specific APIs

This approach keeps everything:

Centralized

Easier to maintain

Faster to experiment with

Better for long-term learning

🚀 Goals

Learn Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile deeply

Understand how to share logic cleanly between Android & iOS

Practice Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI side by side

Experiment with different architectures and patterns

Avoid boilerplate overhead of creating multiple KMM repositories

Build a reusable reference project for future KMM work

🛠 Tech Stack

Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)

Jetpack Compose (Android UI)

SwiftUI (iOS UI)

Kotlin Coroutines / Flow

Gradle (Kotlin DSL)

📌 Note

This project is primarily for learning and experimentation.
Expect frequent refactoring, new sections, and evolving patterns as knowledge grows.
