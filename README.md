# Medronic – Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile Playground

## 📱 Overview

**Medronic** is a Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) learning project focused on building **shared business logic** with **native UIs** using:

- **Jetpack Compose** for Android
- **SwiftUI** for iOS

Instead of creating multiple separate KMM repositories, this project acts as a **single, structured KMM workspace** where multiple mini-projects live together.

Each feature or experiment is organized **section-wise at the package/module level**, making it easier to learn, iterate, and compare implementations without managing many repositories.

---

## 🎯 Primary Goal

The primary goal of this project is to **learn and master Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile** by:

- Sharing common business logic across Android and iOS
- Building fully native UIs on each platform
- Exploring real-world use cases inside a single KMM project

> ⚠️ This repository is designed as a **learning lab**, not a production app.

---

## 🧩 Project Structure Philosophy

Instead of creating a new KMM project for every idea:

- ✅ One **main KMM project**
- ✅ Multiple **package-level / feature-level mini projects**
- ✅ Each section focuses on a specific concept, use case, or experiment

### Example Sections

- Authentication
- Networking
- State management
- Database & caching
- UI + ViewModel integration
- Platform-specific APIs

This approach keeps everything:

- Centralized
- Easier to maintain
- Faster to experiment
- Better for long-term learning

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Learn Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile deeply
- Understand how to share logic cleanly between Android & iOS
- Practice Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI side by side
- Experiment with different architectures and patterns
- Avoid boilerplate overhead of creating multiple KMM repositories
- Build a reusable reference project for future KMM work

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)
- Jetpack Compose (Android UI)
- SwiftUI (iOS UI)
- Kotlin Coroutines / Flow
- Gradle (Kotlin DSL)

---

## 📌 Note

This project is primarily for **learning and experimentation**.  
Expect frequent refactoring, new sections, and evolving patterns as knowledge grows.
